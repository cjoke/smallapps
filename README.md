# Small programs 
(that makes my day more fun) 
*Feel free to download this repo and play with the code. 

This is a collection of small programs I have fun playing with daily.
I have learned python programming language and howto maintain git and 
loads of other stuff along the way. 

This repo is for learning purpose only and there is not other goal
than learning new stuff and if Im lucky some of the programs will 
be usefull. fyi this is my intention.

For IDE I have played around with nvim and different configurations I 
have discovered on the github platform.



## To install requirements I use pip 
e.g : ``` pip install <packagename> ```



##  Permbin
Before use, you will need paste and copy from pyperclip.

### Requirements :

 ``` pip install pyperclip ```
    
To use : 
  just copy some text and execute this program.
  It will give no output. But, 
  it will upload the copied content to termbin.com where you now can
  paste the url (ctrl +v) in a browser and 
  read your content at termbin.com, it is a nice way to share e.g errormessages
  on irc where users tent to be hateful against "spammers". this makes it easy sharing content.


##  readtoaudio
### Requirements :

``` pip install gTTS playsoud  pandas ``` 

 This is similar to firefox text to speech but with alot better 
 quality. readtoaudio is also application independed. With that said
 you can just copy some text from anywhere and execute this program
 and it will play back the text you just copied.
 
 Personally I have made a shortcut that execute this program.
 Where I press "windowskey + s" and it play what I just copied. 
 super convinient.. and fun! :) 


## aichat
### Requirements : 

``` pip install openai speech_recognition ```

 This is a chatbot I made the first time I spoke with openGPT through their webplatform. 
 I made it write examplecodes on how I could make a audiochat application to communicate 
 with the ai bots. This program also logs the conversation with timestamps.
 this aichatbot works but its messy and not redundant. so I guess I will do some cleaning
 when I have time for that. 


## simple task manager
Requirements : 

``` pip install sqlalchemy ```

A simple but dynamic task manager
simple dialog
0 = exit
1 = list tasks
2 = add task
    2.1 = new dialog for adding tasks
3 = remove task
    3.1 = choose task to be removed from the list
HAVE FUN SHARING! :)
