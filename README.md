## Small programs that makes my day more fun. 

This is a collection of small programs I have fun playing with daily.
I have learned python programming language and howto maintain git and 
loads of other stuff along the way. 

For IDE I have played around with nvim and different configurations I 
have discovered on the github platform.



To install requirements I use pip 
e.g : pip install packagename

##  Permbin
Before use, you will need paste and copy from pyperclip.

Requirements : 
 pyperclip
    
To use : 
  just copy some text and execute this program.
  It will give no output. But, 
  it will give back and store an url in your system memory.
  
  You can now paste the url (ctrl +v) in a browser and read your copied content at pastebin.com or,
  you can share the url with anyone that want/need to read your content at termbin.com. 
  Or both.



##  readtoaudio
Requirements : 
 gTTS
 playsoud
 pandas 

 This is similar to firefox text to speech but with alot better 
 quality. readtoaudio is also application independed. With that said
 you can just copy some text from anywhere and execute this program
 and it will play back the text you just copied.
 
 Personally I have made a shortcut that execute this program.
 Where I press "windowskey + s" and it play what I just copied. 
 super convinient.. and fun! :) 


## aichat
Requirement : 
 openai
 speech_recognition

 This is a chatbot I made the first time I spoke with openGPT through their webplatform. 
 I made it write examplecodes on how I could make a audiochat application to communicate 
 with the ai bots. This program also logs the conversation with timestamps.
 this aichatbot works but its messy and not redundant. so I guess I will do some cleaning
 when I have time for that. 



HAVE FUN SHARING! :)
